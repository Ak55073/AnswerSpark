4842,162,12,Amused Blaise?  We'll see just who's laughing in the end
4843,162,12,Where's Harry?

5144,169,2,How was what?
5145,169,3,Your dinner party
5146,169,2,Dead boring  Though I think Harry enjoyed dessert
5147,169,3,Ol' Sluggy's having a Christmas do you know  And we're meant to bring someone
5172,170,3,Ah  Well they're really good
5174,170,3,Oops  I think this room's taken
5175,170,65,What's with the birds?
5176,170,2,Oppugno
5177,170,3,It feels like this

5192,171,8,Drink?
5193,171,10,Neville?

5196,171,123,What're you doing?
5197,171,1,And what's happened to you?
5198,171,1,Hm?  Oh I've just escaped -- I mean left Cormac  Under the mistletoe
5199,171,3,Cormac  That's who you invited
5201,171,3,Dragon tartar?
5228,172,2,Positive  Why?
5229,172,1,It's just well you can't break an Unbreakable Vow
5230,172,2,I'd worked that much out for myself funnily enough
5231,172,1,No you don't understand -- Oh bloody hell
5232,172,2,Lovely
5239,173,1,Voldemort has chosen Draco Malfoy for a mission?
5240,173,11,I know it sounds mad --
5242,173,11,That's not what it sounded like
5243,173,1,Perhaps Harry's right Remus  To make an Unbreakable Vow after all --
5244,173,61,It comes down to whether or not you trust Dumbledore's judgement He trusts Snape  Therefore I do
5245,173,11,But Dumbledore can make mistakes He's said it himself --
5246,173,1,You're blinded by hatred
5300,174,24,Go on
5303,174,8,Confused?  I would be surprised if you weren't
5304,174,4,I don't understand -- what happened?
5306,174,4,But why would he tamper with his own memory?
5307,174,1,I suspect he is ashamed of it
5308,174,4,Why?
5309,174,1,Why indeed
5310,174,4,I asked you to get to know Professor Slughorn and you've done so
5316,175,8,Ah If it isn't the Prince of Potions himself  To what do I owe the pleasure?
5317,175,8,Well sir I wondered if I might ask you something
5318,175,1,Ask away my dear boy ask away
5320,175,1,Yes?  And exactly what was this rare magic
5329,175,3,Nice
5331,175,3,Hermione  I think Malfoy's leaving the castle
5332,175,1,I've seen it  Sometimes sometimes he just disappears off the Map
5333,175,1,That's not possible  No one can leave the castle these days The Map is wrong
5334,175,3,The Map is never wrong
5335,175,1,It's beautiful isn't it?  The moon
5409,176,3,Huh?
5415,176,2,Right  Boggled
5416,176,3,That's Katie  That's Katie Bell

5421,176,12,Sectumsempra
5422,176,1,Don't touch me  Don't you dare touch me
5423,176,12,You have to get rid of it  Today
5429,177,20,What was that?
5430,177,20,See you never know what you'll find up here
5431,177,20,All right  Close your eyes  That way you can't be tempted
5432,177,20,There's something else  Another secret of sorts  One of mine
5433,177,20,That can stay hidden up here too if you like
5434,177,20,So  Did you and Ginny do it?
5435,178,2,What?
5436,178,1,You know  Hide the book
5437,178,2,Oh  Yeah
5438,178,1,Still no luck with Slughorn I take it?
5439,178,2,Say that again
5440,178,1,Well?  How do you feel?
5441,178,3,Excellent  Really excellent
5486,178,5,And Odo the hero they bore him back home
5490,179,8,Tha's odd
5491,179,5,Isn't it?  That's life I suppose One goes along and then poof
5492,179,8,That's never unicorn hair Hagrid?
5493,179,8,Hagrid looks up reels a bit  Nods
5494,179,8,But my dear chap do you know how much that's worth?
5495,179,8,No idea no idea at all
5510,180,8,Intuition
5512,180,8,Look sharp Tom  You don't want to be caught out of bed after hours
5513,180,8,I know a secret shortcut or two
